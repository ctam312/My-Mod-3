# Design Notes
Focused on the pillars:

White Space
--empty space around text images, elements, etc --> increases legibility and usability

Colors
--contains Aesthetics && Accessibility
--pleasing colors 

Typography
--what type of font we uses matters

Conventions
--commonly used things like 3 lines for a menu icon
